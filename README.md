# city-crawlers-game
City Crawlers is a top-down hack-and-slash game featuring multiple game modes, multiplayer, waves of minions, and customizable character abilities.

NOTE: This project has been put on the back burner for now. I love the concept and would love to come back to it, but as a debut project for a single developer, this was way too complex and too deep.
